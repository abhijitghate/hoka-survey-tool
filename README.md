# hoka-survey-tool

The project consists of a Django backend and a ReactJS frontend.

It aims at creating a survey tool wherein user can distribute the forms created by admin and record the responses of the people.
It also shows detials such as number of resonses and the users who have submitted the response. 

The solutions is a full-stack solution.

Right now, we have to add the Forms from the Django backend. Had I have more time, I could have added the sunctionality to create a new
form on the frontend.
